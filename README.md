Oracle bone script (OBS) are among the world’s independently evolved scripts, yet roughly two-thirds of the 4,500 characters remain undeciphered due to obscure forms, sparse and fragmented texts, and limited corroborating evidence. We present AlphaOracle, a comprehensive, workflow-inspired framework that systematizes OBS decipherment by integrating computer vision, computational linguistics, and classical philology. AlphaOracle curates the largest digitized OBS resources to date and operationalizes them through a multi-stage framework comprising rubbing parsing, radical-based morphological analysis with diachronic modeling, contextual retrieval with semantic alignment, and philological validation against classical sources. Each stage yields explicit evidence chains with quantitative scores, culminating in interpretable reports for scholarly verification. Our results indicate that computational methods, when aligned with philological practice, can accelerate OBS decipherment and provide a framework that could inform the study of other undeciphered scripts within digital humanities and cultural heritage research.

## Key Features

- Rubbing Processing: involving character detection, character recognition, sentence segmentation, intra-sentence ordering, and translation into Modern English/Chinese.
<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/en/key1.png" width="600">
</div>

- Morphological Analysis: investigating the diachronic evolution of their glyph forms, analyzing their component structures and configurations, and generating descriptions of their morphological features. 
<div align="center">
  <img src="figures/en/key2.png" width="600">
</div>

- Contextual Alignment: given a single character image as a query, the system retrieves visually similar glyphs and displays each within its full rubbing or transcription context. This allows researchers to examine how the character appears across inscriptions, compare its usage in different settings, and identify patterns of meaning, function, or variation that inform its interpretation.

</div>

- Philological Grounding: based on the glyphic form and semantic meaning of a specific oracle bone character, the system performs a deep search across a dual corpus—encompassing early transmitted Chinese texts (from the pre-Qin and Han dynasties) and modern scholarly literature—to discover and present the most relevant discussions, evidence, and research findings.

## Tutorial

This project includes a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the usage of each API in AlphaOracle. It begins by defining common utilities and wrapper functions, and then demonstrates the input and output formats for each task in separate code blocks.
